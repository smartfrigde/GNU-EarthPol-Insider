# GNU/EarthPol-Insider
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ac9NTUcuDG)    
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as EarthPol Insider, is in fact, GNU/EarthPol-Insider, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus EarthPol Insider. Insider is not an EarthPol unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full server as defined by 0XBIT.
